<!-- What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression? -->

1. Function Declaration
A function declaration is a statement that defines a named function. 
It is hoisted, meaning it can be called before it appears in the code.

function greet() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
  
  greet(); // This works because the function is hoisted.

  2. Function Expression
  A function expression defines a function and assigns it to a variable (or constant). 
  The function is not hoisted, so it cannot be called before the expression is assigned.

  const greet = function() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  };
  
  greet(); // This works only after the function expression is assigned.
